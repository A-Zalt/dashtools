# DashTools

Node.js library for interacting with Geometry Dash servers. Every single endpoint is implemented, but currently not tested very well.

This library is a work in progress. In the future it will also include tools for level string creation and save file reading/writing.

Support for version below 2.2 is very limited at the moment.
